Here's the translation of the text you provided:

Team 6399 Tinspiratio was founded in 2016 and participated in its first competition in 2017, initially relying on the technical center of Jinan Foreign Language School. Currently, Team 6399 belongs to the Tornado Engineering Society under the International Curriculum Center of Jinan Foreign Language School, where students learn and practice robotics knowledge through daily club activities. Since its establishment, 6399 has adhered to a student-led operation mode with no mentors, allowing students to explore and experiment independently. The team is self-organized and competes autonomously. In past competitions, 6399 has won several awards: the 2017 Rookie Award and Team Spirit Award, the 2018 Technology Innovation Award, the 2019 Team Spirit Award, the 2021 Final Four Alliance, and the 2022 China Playoffs Entrepreneurial Spirit Award. Additionally, 6399 is the only team from Shandong participating in this competition.

As one of the earliest-established clubs at Jinan Foreign Language School, the Tornado Engineering Society has actively participated in various school events since its inception, frequently organizing the schoolâ€™s Science Festival and collaborating with multiple other clubs.
